The goal is to create an analysis of house prices of Melbourne Australia.
Data is retrieved from the state government's website with additional collaboration.
Main data from
https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/victorian-property-sales-report-median-house-by-suburb-time-series
Combined with additional data from 
https://goo.gl/VbLsLg

The program itself is a Shiny-R dashboard.   

## Improvements

1. Loading time too long.   Using Plotly for the graphs is taking too much time to optimise User experience

2. Details of data.  The app can be linked to more detailed price data for a better analysis.

3. Selection of directions and distances could be programmed into the map.  

4. instead median price, the range and standard deviation of data can be used for better analysis.
